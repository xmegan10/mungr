\usage{
clean_text(x, ...)

\method{clean_text}{MungrCleaner}(x, case = NULL, trim = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class MungrCleaner containing the data to clean.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used).}

\item{case}{Character. Specifies the case conversion to apply to character
columns. Options are "lower", "upper", or "title". If
NULL (default), no case conversion is performed.}

\item{trim}{Logical. If TRUE (default), leading and trailing whitespace
is removed from all character columns, and any resulting empty strings ("")
are converted to NA.}
}
\value{
The updated MungrCleaner object.

The updated MungrCleaner object with cleaned character columns
in its $data component and an entry in the processing $log.
}
\description{
This generic function standardizes text in
character columns by trimming whitespace, converting empty strings
to NA, and standardizing cases.
}
\details{
The cleaning process is applied only to columns of type character.
The order of operations is always: Trim and Replace Empty to Whitespace is trimmed to
empty strings replaced with NA values to case conversion transformation.
}
\examples{
# Assume MungrCleaner and clean_text generic are defined.

# --- 1. Example Data Setup ---
messy_df <- data.frame(
  Text_Case = c(" Apple ", "banana", "Cherry"),
  Text_Empty = c(" hello ", " ", ""),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
cleaner <- MungrCleaner(messy_df)

# --- 2. Run Cleaning ---
# Trim whitespace, convert empty to NA, and force lowercase
cleaner_cleaned <- clean_text(cleaner, case = "lower", trim = TRUE)

# --- 3. Expected Results ---
# The 'Text_Empty' column's " " and "" rows are now NA.
# 'Text_Case' is now "apple", "banana", "cherry".
